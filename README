For this homework I have implemented a Skiplist which I use to 
keep track of the scoreboard and, later on, to sort the players
by points. The SkipList class contains several member functions
that help create and modify the skiplist itself.

I have used the skiplist firstly to store the racers by their ids
so it is more efficient to access them when it is needed to add
points to their current score. Upon every print request, I have
created a copy of the current skiplist by overwriting the = 
operator and adding the elements by their scores so it sorts the
scoreboard automatically. 

In the function that calculates the standings after each race, 
I have used 2 arrays: one that stores the ids and one that stores
the score for every player in this manner: the player id[k] has
the score score[k]. The points are being distributed after I sort
the time array ascending and the id array accordingly. Furthermore,
I updated the score in the skiplist for each player and their
position after the current race. In the end, I checked whether a
print has been requested, and, if so, I updated the previous print
position of the player in the skiplist and I made another skiplist 
which adds the elements from the first one by score and I printed
it to the output file.
